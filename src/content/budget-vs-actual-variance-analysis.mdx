For this piece, I’ll dive into a tactical analysis that is important to every CEO and CFO, the budget vs actual variance analysis.

What is the Budget vs Actual Variance Analysis
It is a comparison of your company’s planned financial performance (budget) compared against the final financial results (actual) for a given time period. The variance is the difference between the budget and actual, typically expressed as a percentage difference or total cash difference. The purpose of variance analysis is to segment the business into its building blocks and understand how each block is performing. In the process, we may encounter questions such as:

Why is North America sales selling our core product better than Europe sales? Is it because we don’t understand our European customers or is it because the Europe sales team isn’t performing well?
Why is sales efficiency down? Sales and marketing expenditure up proportionally more than sales compared to the previous year. Is it a low performing sales rep or ineffective marketing campaigns?
Are the variances being driven by operational shortcomings or are there macro economic changes that we weren’t prepared for? How should we adjust the forecast going forward?
Let’s consider an example where the company misses revenue targets by 8%. That’s not good but now what? How does the CEO/CFO act on this information?

The real value is in the details. Total revenue is the summation of its parts. If it were a software company, its revenue could be broken down into monthly subscription revenue, pay-as-you-go revenue, professional services revenue, and proof of concept revenue. Depending on the company, revenue can also be segmented by customer location (geography) or customer industry (sector). When we drill down, we may learn that North America sales beat expectations by 12% but Europe sales were down 20%. In this case, the CFO would simply need to talk to the Europe sales leader, rather than the entire sales organization.
