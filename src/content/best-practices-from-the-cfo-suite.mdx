Forward
In the current economic crisis, business leaders from early-stage startups to large multinational corporations have had to make difficult decisions. The financial implication of these decision is critical and the CFO is the executive helping the CEO navigate these decisions. Historically, the CFO role was focused on backward looking information: ensuring on-time and accurate financial reporting. The CFO role has evolved into a highly strategic role but needs a robust system to handle the day-to-day reporting tasks and generate accurate financial information.

My motivation was to understand the responsibility of the CFO suite, the process of billing to accounting, and the software tools available to run an effective finance office. I interviewed 50 people that held CFO, finance manager, and financial analyst type roles. The companies represented include venture backed startups, mid-sized businesses, and large multinationals.

The findings are heavily geared towards software-as-a-service technology startups. In the following, you will find a synthesis of the key findings on the following topics:

How do you view the responsibility of the CFO suite?
System for a high functioning finance office
Integrating disparate finance tools
Getting full visibility to subscription revenue
Financial planning of the CFO suite
How do you view the responsibility of the CFO suite?
The following are select responses from the finance leaders. Their titles include CEO, CTO, COO, CFO, and VP of Finance of venture-backed startups. Edited for readability.
