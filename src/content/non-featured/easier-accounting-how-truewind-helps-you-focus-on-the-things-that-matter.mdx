For too long, startups have tried to solve bookkeeping thru a set of rules üôÑ But bookkeeping isn't a set of rules. It's a set of guidelines! Bookkeeping isn't just numbers. It requires business context üí°

Doesn't this sound like the 10x better experience that you deserve? ‚ú®Truewind brings a delightful accounting and finance experience to fast growing companies.

Challenge
The challenge faced by most companies is that you are unable to prioritize bookkeeping due to time constraints. As a result, it was put off until the last possible moment and dealt with painfully.

Solution
However, implementing Truewind helps companies to become more proactive in their approach towards bookkeeping.

Results
Consequently, the founders and employees now have more time to focus on other important tasks such as revenue and growth.

Challenges
Founding teams have a clear focus on ensuring their customers' success. For a developer tool, this means making the software engineers life easier. For a sales lead gen tool, this means providing better quality leads to SDRs. This emphasis on their customers' needs, however, leave very little time for bookkeeping.

Every year, their tax preparer would remind the team that you needed to get the books in order to file taxes. But because time was limited, CEO and founder often put off bookkeeping, making it challenging to ask specific questions about their finances. Although your customers are receiving excellent service, your internal finances suffer.

Eventually, you'll realize that you need to take action. Being the forward-thinking leader you are, you decide you want to leverage technology without locking yourself into a proprietary system. Flexibility is important here.

Solution
