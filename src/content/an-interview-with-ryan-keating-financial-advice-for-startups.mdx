I recently spoke with finance leaders from a couple dozen startups. Their expertise ranged from seed stage start-ups, where the CEO also served as the in-house finance leader, to growth stage companies where an in-house CFO monitored the entity’s current and future financial health. In these conversations, I observed that each finance leader had a different perspective and approach when engaging with their financial accounting partner.

I caught up with Ryan Keating, Managing Director of Keating Consulting Group, to get his perspective after 20 years of accelerating growth in venture-backed startups. Keating Consulting Group is a Silicon Valley-based firm that provides interim CFO services and back office support to start-ups ranging from pre-seed to Series C stage.
